# reverse_stress_testing


Reverse stress testing in finance is a risk management technique where the starting point is a specific undesirable outcome, such as a significant capital shortfall or insolvency. The goal is to work backward to identify the scenarios or conditions that could lead to this outcome. Unlike traditional stress testing, which assesses the impact of predefined scenarios on a financial institution, reverse stress testing helps identify potential vulnerabilities that might not be apparent under normal circumstances.


The capital ratio is a measure of a bank's capital relative to its risk-weighted assets. A critical capital ratio is a threshold below which the bank's financial health is considered at risk. It is often set by regulators (e.g., Basel III standards). The capital ratio (CR) is given by:
CR = Capital / Assets
Where:
Capital includes the bank's equity capital.
Assets are the total assets on the bank's balance sheet.


A stress scenario in reverse stress testing consists of hypothetical adverse changes in the bank's assets and liabilities. The scenario is defined by:
Asset Loss Rate (L_a): The percentage loss in the value of the bank's assets.
Liability Increase Rate (L_l): The percentage increase in the bank's liabilities.


Under a stress scenario, the bank's assets and liabilities are adjusted based on the asset loss rate and liability increase rate. The stressed capital ratio (CR_s) is calculated as:
Stressed Assets = Assets * (1 - L_a)
Stressed Liabilities = Liabilities * (1 + L_l)
Stressed Capital = Stressed Assets - Stressed Liabilities
CR_s = Stressed Capital / Stressed Assets
Where:
Stressed Assets are the assets after applying the asset loss rate.
Stressed Liabilities are the liabilities after applying the liability increase rate.
Stressed Capital is the difference between stressed assets and stressed liabilities.


The reverse stress testing process involves systematically varying the asset loss rate (L_a) and liability increase rate (L_l) to identify combinations that cause the bank's capital ratio to fall below the critical threshold:
Step 1: Define a critical capital ratio (CR_c) that represents the point at which the bank would be considered undercapitalized or at risk of failure.
Step 2: Apply different combinations of asset loss rates and liability increase rates.
Step 3: Calculate the stressed capital ratio for each combination.
Step 4: Identify the scenarios where the stressed capital ratio (CR_s) is less than or equal to the critical capital ratio (CR_c).
